<h1 >🧠 Awesome Slab Website</h1>

<p>Welcome to the "Awesome Slab Website" repository. This is a coded version of a previously designed interface design. This is a landing page design.</p>
<h3>Only with HTML, SCSS and JS technology.</h3>
<p>In this project, I used only HTML, SCSS and JS technologies. I used the SCSS structure because it is easier and more fun. If you've used SCSS before, I highly recommend it. </p>

<h3>🏃‍♂️ View and browse the design freely with the demo.</h3>
<p>I will share the demo link to see the design and browse comfortably. <a href="https://slab.karrc.com">You can click me to see the demo.</a></p>
